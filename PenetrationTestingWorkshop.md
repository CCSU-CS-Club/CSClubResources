`SSID - RasPwn OS` <br/>

Raspwn OS is a GNU/Linux distro that uses a Raspberry Pi 2B or 3 to emulate a vulnerable Linux Server. RasPwn was designed as a training tool and exists only to be attacked and pwned. Everything from the OS itself to the daemons and services to the web applications installed are all vulnerable to some degree. The idea is to provide a 'safe' (relatively) and affordable training environment and playground for hackers and pen-testers. By loading Raspwn OS and connecting to the Raspberry Pi via WiFi, one can practice pen-testing as well as both offensive and defensive hacking techniques without ever even getting on the internet for only around $50.
